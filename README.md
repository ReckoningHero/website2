# Description
A personal website that I created in Javascript,HTMl, CSS, and some C#. I write blogs, game reviews, and program some VR game programmed with JQuery and Node.js here. Additionally, I have some personal projects I developed in Unity, Unreal Engine 4, and basic .NET applications on the side on my free time.
