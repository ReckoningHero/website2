# Description and notes
A personal project website that I created in   JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and some C#. I write blogs, game reviews, and program some VR game programmed with JQuery and Node.js here. Additionally, I have some personal projects I developed in Unity, Unreal Engine 4, and very basic .NET applications on the side on my free time.
