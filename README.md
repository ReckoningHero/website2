# Description and notes

A personal project website that I created in  JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and some C#. I write blogs, game reviews, and program some VR game programmed with JQuery and Node.js here. Additionally, I have some personal projects I developed in Unity, Unreal Engine 4, and very basic .NET applications on the side on my free time.

# Notes

Using this website for the pages and sites. Using the latest HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The website can vary from blogs and notes from projects from portfolio.

B:  Create a blog posts that can influence any wannabe programmers to learn how to code theatrically and practically.

C:  Change copyright name and year.

D:  Add search engine on the homepage for end user to search case-sensitive words exactly.
