## .NET Framework and what is C#?
.NET is a software framework which is developed by Microsoft. The very first .NET framework was introduced in 2002 for compiling and executing programs written in different languages like C#, VB.Net etc. It is used to develop Form-based applications, web-based applications and Web services.

For C#, the language itself helps us to understand the result for multi-paradigm to encompass strong typing,
imperative, declarative, functional, generic, and object-oriented/class-based programming disciplines. As C#
is derived from the C programming language, it also introduces some unique and significantly powerful features in regards to lambda expressions and function pointers which introduce elements of functional programming languages, as well as a simpler single class.

When we take into consideration with .NET Framework while coding C#, we can implement the a fairly powerful language into a framework from a unified set of class libraries and CLR (Common Language Runtime) which executes the .NET framework we want to convert from a complied of algorithmic source code.
