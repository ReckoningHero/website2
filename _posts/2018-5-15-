C++ offers the ability to demonstrate the search for algorithm that requires any pariticular array to be sorted out before any 
search is applied from the user. What you learned in your introductory classes in college or maybe (hopefully) teach yourself is 
the ability to understand how algorithm itself is sorted to find an item in an ordered list. The objective to demostrate the algorithm 
is to be able to discard half of the array within each iterationand leave the final value output of the code. 

For example, we can take this example for instance:


```yaml

---
int array[] = 
{ 
    1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 17, 19, 21, 23, 34, 40, 45, 71, 100 
};
