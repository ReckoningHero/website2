## What is a Software Developer?

When I started learning programming on own free will many years ago, I thought the hobby would die out on me since at first I hate memorizing logics/conditions and even debugging solutions based on some documentation that wants exactly what fits in its criteria. I was more on the right-brain, creative kind of guy to begin with since looking at the a grey/black console application screen is too mundane and lack of interactivity from a creative perspective. I come to realize that the hobby can in fact be creative and engaging as much as you want and you don't have to follow the rules, you make the rules in fact. (That what's being a developer is all about!!)
