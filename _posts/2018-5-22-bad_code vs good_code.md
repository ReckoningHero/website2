title: Bad Code vs Good Code

---
When we consider the implementation of our code, we need to comphend the concepts of what makes a effective algorithms from a horrible algorithms. Having a bad code can undermines some fundemental flaws in our thinking of implementation our algorithms and presentation. 
Good code is well-organized and written thought out. One of the key factors of a good code is data and operations in classes fit together effectively. Consider the bad code from being too complicated from your user to actually understand or acknowledge or what are you writing or explaining about.
