# What is C++?
![image tooltip here](/assets/img/Cplusplus.png)


In the programming world, C++ is a programming language that comes from a lower-level language compared to Java and Python. It was designed to be an object-oriented programming language that can write programs for many applications we have in today's softwares such as our operating systems(Windows, Linux) and modern video games (Unreal Engine, some Unity).  Back int the 80s, a computer scientist named Bjarne 
Stroustrup developed the language for the idea and concept to have the original C language to have "C with classes". He wanted to have some features for the C language with  some exception handling, operator overloading, and templates. Additionally, he also wanted to add some classes, derived classes, strong typing, inlining and default arguments. This created the C language with a proper static library than its original counterpart. Other interesting note, Stroustrup received a 2018 Chalres Stark Draper Prize for Engineering from the National Academy of Engineering and $500,000 for his accomplishment to our society.

## What applications we used this language in today's technology?
