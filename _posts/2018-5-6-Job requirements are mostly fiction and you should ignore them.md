<blockquote class="embedly-card"><h4><a href="https://qz.com/255565/job-requirements-are-mostly-fiction-and-you-should-ignore-them/">Job requirements are mostly fiction and you should ignore them</a></h4><p>In job searches, people frequently look at the listed requirements, see a gap, and move on, fearing rejection and not wanting to waste the employer's time and their own. They're making a big mistake, and potentially holding their careers back. A job posting doesn't describe a real person.</p></blockquote>
