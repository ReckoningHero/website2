What is CI/CD? The implementation is also known as the CI/CD pipeline and is one of the best practices for devops teams to implement.
In software engineering, CI/CD refers to the combined practices that many software developers today mostly talk about. 

## CI(Continuous intergration)

With CI(Continuous intergration), Developers practice the continous intergration that merge their changes withe the main branch as often as possible.
Developers' changes are only vaildated by running and creating a build to automatized any test in which can be against any build. In order to do so, it 
must be avoided from integration to merge developers' changes into the release branch.

Continous intgration helps us to understand a great emphasis in testing automation whicile checking if the appuication is or isnt broken whenever any commitment
is integrated into the main branch from whatever circumstances. 

## CD(Continuous Deployment)

Continuous deployment helps us goes one stop further than continuous delivery. While practicing this method, every change that a developer passes all stages of the pipline, it is 
released to any clients for software delivery.
