   I am a learner of all things software from inside and out. I have been a active programmer since the age of 15. Even since, I dive myself into a world of informations and algorithms that entice my passion to continue the pathway as a programmer. First programming language was Java, then it was C++. C++ thrives my enthusiasm with many IDE and SDK software such as game development and software in day to day basis needs. I specialized in game development such as Unity and Unreal Engine 4 and .NET devlopment for desktop apps and sometimes websites. I am right now currently learning VR development so I can kickstart my career as maybe a future indie game developer. Even to this day, I am still learning each and every day to learn more about software implematation and how real world development works as time passes since learning my first code, “Hello World”!
